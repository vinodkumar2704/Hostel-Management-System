# Hostel-Management-System
Hostel Management System project as a part of our course made with PhP and JavaScript. Specific to requirements.


This project work proposes a NITC Hostel Management system web application for students so that they can register to hostels.

## Installation Process:
<li> Requirements: apache server(xampp),web browser

I used Xampp for mysql and apache server which comes on installing xampp.
If using a different database change the config file in includes folder accordingly.
Create Database and tables before starting the site.The details were provided in the database folder.
After starting the server, search localhost/dbms in the browser and the website works fine.
